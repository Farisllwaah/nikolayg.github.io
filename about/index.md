<strong>Hi there,</strong>

My name is <span class="myname">Nikolay Grozev (a.k.a. Nik)</span>. 
I'm a PhD candidate at the [Cloud Computing and Distributed Systems](http://www.gridbus.org/) (CLOUDS) 
Laboratory, [University of Melbourne](http://www.unimelb.edu.au/ "http://www.unimelb.edu.au/"), 
Australia.

In my PhD I investigate how to architect large scale web applications so they can use multiple Clouds. This will make them legislation compliant, more resilient to outages and will increase the Quality of Experience (QoE). I am developing adaptive architectures and using online machine learning techniques to “learn” the application’s behaviour in real time and allocate computing resources adequately.

This is an exciting and important topic and you can learn more by exploring <span>[my latest publications](#publications)</span> and [my blog](https://nikolaygrozev.wordpress.com/ "https://nikolaygrozev.wordpress.com/").
