<div class="about-page-content">

    <p class="stress">Hi there,</p>

    <p>My name is <span class="myname">Nikolay Grozev (a.k.a. Nik)</span>. 
    I’m a software engineer and researcher interested in everything to do with
    software development, distributes systems, programming languages, functional programming, 
    teaching programming, and building cool stuff.</p>

    <p>In my previous life, I was an academic and I hold a PhD in Computer Science from the
    <a href="http://www.unimelb.edu.au/" title="http://www.unimelb.edu.au/">University of Melbourne</a>, Australia.
    My PhD was about architecting large scale web applications so they can use multiple Clouds. 
    I developed adaptive architectures and used online machine learning techniques 
    to “learn” the application’s behaviour in real time and allocate computing resources adequately.</p>

    <p>You can check out my <a href="/publications">publications</a> and <a href="/blog">blog</a> to 
    learn more about my work.</p>
